BBC Sound Effects Downloader
============================

The script intent is to create a local mirror of the BBC Sound Effects available at :
http://bbcsfx.acropolis.org.uk/

This may be useful for research centers as they might need to use large datasets.

Usage
=====

The script is written to be "fire and forget" like. Use it in screen / tmux / whatever.

All sounds will be downloaded in the current working directory and use names as `CDNumber/CDNumber_tracknum description.extension`

Already downloaded files will not be downloaded again, remove them to force a download.

Licences
========

The Sound Effects are under RemArc Licence (check website).

Consider this script in public domain.
